# IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate-Capstone-Project

About this Professional Certificate

Data Science has been ranked as one of the hottest professions, with a high need for data practitioners. This IBM Professional Certificate is designed for anyone who wants to gain skills and expertise in Data Science or Machine Learning.

This program comprises ten courses that will provide you with the most up-to-date job-ready skills and techniques in data science, including open source tools and libraries, methodologies, Python, databases, SQL, data visualization, data analysis, and machine learning. You will practice hands-on in the IBM Cloud using real data science tools and real-world data sets.

It is a common misconception that a Ph.D. is required to become a data scientist. This Professional Certificate is appropriate for anyone with basic computer abilities and a desire to self-learn. There is no requirement for prior computer science or programming knowledge. We start simple, reinforce applicable learning, then progress to more complicated topics.

After successfully completing these courses, you will have completed multiple hands-on assignments and established a portfolio of data science projects, giving you the confidence to enter an exciting career in data science. In addition to receiving a Professional Certificate from Coursera, you will also receive a digital Badge from IBM acknowledging your Data Science competency.

Applied Learning Project 

This professional credential places a heavy emphasis on hands-on experience. With the exception of the first course, all other courses contain a series of hands-on labs and are delivered via the IBM Cloud (at no cost to you). Throughout this Professional Certificate, you will be introduced to a variety of tools, libraries, cloud services, datasets, algorithms, assignments, and projects that will give you with practical abilities that are transferable to real-world employment that employers value, such as:
Jupyter / JupyterLab notebooks, Zeppelin notebooks, R Studio, and Watson Studio are available as tools. Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, ipython-sql, Scikit-learn, ScipPy, and other libraries are available. Projects include a random album generator, the prediction of home values, the best classifier model, and a war of communities.
